## Introduction
Wiki Trend is a tool that recommends users other popular and related Wikipedia articles based on the current Wikipedia article they are browsing. For this project, I am using Wikipedia monthly clickstream data which can accurately captures clickstream activities from Wikipedia. I hope users can discover areas of interests and topics based on their current activity through this tool.

## Motivation
I learned about "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" and it has always fascinated me. "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" is an idea that there will always be a path with less than 6 degrees of seperation between two Wikipedia articles. When I was playing around with this idea, I found a lot of information and knowledge. For example, I learned about "1860 Republican National Convention" on my journey from "Chicago" to "Donald Trump". 

Since people read a lot of Wikipedia posts and there are millions of related articles, my main goal for the Insight Data Engineering Project is to build a tool that can help users to decide other interesting topics that they can read. 

## Demo
I created a tool so that people could learn more about related Wikipedia articles based on the current article they are reading. Here is a video recording of the website I built using Flask:

## What does my project do?
### Supported Queries
A user can specify the title of a Wikipedia article.

### Data Source
~30 GB Wikipedia monthly aggregated clickstream data with over 3 millions recorded articles, and 400 millions clickstream.

## Pipeline

## Database Design
### Why Neo4j?
Neo4j is a graph-based NoSQL which delivers the lightning-fast read and write performance for graph database. For clickstream data, it can be easily expressed in a graph. Neo4j can also greatly reduce analysis time with its built-in graph-based algorithm, such as pageRank and betweenness centrality algorithms. 

The problem I solved worked perfectly with Neo4j. I needed to use a database that could query the connected components based on user's input. In order to display the related Wikipedia articles quickly and reliably I needed a database that efficiently stored all of the graph data.
