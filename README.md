Insight Data Engineering</br>
New York 2019B</br>

## Introduction
Wiki Trend is a tool that recommends users other popular and related Wikipedia articles based on the current Wikipedia article they are browsing. For this project, I am using Wikipedia monthly clickstream data which can accurately captures clickstream activities from Wikipedia. I hope users can discover areas of interests and topics based on their current activity through this tool.

## Motivation
I learned about "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" and it has always fascinated me. "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" is an idea that there will always be a path with less than 6 degrees of seperation between two Wikipedia articles. When I was playing around with this idea, I found a lot of information and knowledge. For example, I learned about "1860 Republican National Convention" on my journey from "Chicago" to "Donald Trump". 

Since people read a lot of Wikipedia posts and there are millions of related articles, my main goal for the Insight Data Engineering Project is to build a tool that can help users to decide other interesting topics that they can read.
